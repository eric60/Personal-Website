I've recently taken a hand at trading crypto currencies and it has been unbelievable learning about the technology behind 
the blockchain and how each coin is hoping to diversify itself into a top traded currency. The most problematic issue I've 
seen is scaling the functionality of the blockchain in order to deal with the massive increase in usage. Too many people using 
the blockchain slows down transactions to a crawl and many coins are hoping to solve the scalability issue through faster 
algorithm solving in mining the blocks. 

To increase liquidity of a coin, other coins have emerged with proof of stake(POS) 
mining rather than the proof of work mining that bitcoin employs. Through POS anyone can receive a percentage stake of the 
coin just by holding the coin instead of using electricity and processing power to mine blocks through solving algorithims. 
This POS can attract investors to want to buy and hold the coin to gain stake and potentially earn more coins, however it can
also lead to hyper inflation of the coin which I've seen first hand.
